# Hawks Nest live countup

This is a small toolbox to create a countup

During the Cub Games, I was asked to film the kids of the Crossfit Hawks Nest Binche box live. I used the OBS tool to retransmit several cameras live on social networks. 

Since these are sports performances and time was important. I realized a service that allows to refresh the content of the txt file with the time since the start. 

This software is orchestrated by a simple API and the features are very basic. 

## Dev remarks

This tool is not the cleanest and is not finished (with hardcoded data). It was developed in 15 minutes to meet a single need. If you want to improve it, you can always create a fork and PR it.
